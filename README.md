# Wafer Fault Detection Using Machine Learning

This project automates the process of detecting faults in silicon wafers based on sensor data using Machine Learning. It helps identify defective wafers during the manufacturing process to improve quality and reduce human intervention.

## 📌 Problem Statement

In semiconductor manufacturing, determining whether a wafer is faulty or not is essential for product quality. This system uses historical sensor data to build a classification model that predicts whether a wafer is "Faulty" or "Good".

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Pandas, NumPy**
- **Flask (Web App)**
- **Logging & Exception Handling**
- **CI/CD (Coming Soon)**
